                                If Alex borrows $10,000 to purchase a car, Alex is expected to pay back the loan "with interest".
                                <strong>Interest is the cost of borrowing money</strong>.
                                Alex agreed to a 5% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of interest on the loan, but does not make any payments;
                                after one year Alex owes $10,500, and after two years he owes $11025.

                                    1 Year: <code>$10,000 x 5% = $500 in interest</code>
                                    <br />
                                    2 Years: <code>$10,500 x 5% = $525 in compound interest</code>

                                Alex owes more in interest the second year because he is paying interest on both the initial principal and the previously
                                accumulated interest; this is called <strong>Compound Interest</strong>. In this context, Compound Interest is very bad
                                because it causes your debt to grow at an exponential rate. However, you may have heard of the phrase "Compound Interest"
                                used in a positive way; this is because many people confuse Compound Interest with a similar concept: Compound Rate of Return.

                                Although the example above shows why unpaid debt can accumulate quickly, we can employ the same principles to investing to see how an
                                investment can grow over time. If we earn income from an investment but reinvest our income back into the investment, the next income
                                we earn from the investment will be based on both the principal and the previous income: this is called
                                <strong>Compound Rate of Return</strong>. A rate of return is the gain (profit) of an investment, expressed as a percentage of the
                                investment. Although this rate of return is not "interest", it functions in much the same way. It is common for the term "compound
                                interest" to be applied to investment gains, though technically "compound rates of return" may be more appropriate.

                                Compound interest / compound rates of return are hard to calculate in your head. Thankfully there is an easy-to-remember formula
                                for determining the effects of compounding over time: <strong>The Rule of 72!</strong> Divide 72 by the rate of return (or interest rate) to get an
                                approximation of how long it will take your principal to double.
                            </p>

                            Formula:
                            <div class="card">
                                <div class="card-body">
                                    <code>72 / Rate = No. of years</code>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            Example: An investment with an annual interest rate of 4% should double in approximately 18 years.
                            <div class="card">
                                <div class="card-body">
                                    <code>72 / 4 = 18</code>
                                </div>

                                A "stock" is a security (i.e. tradable asset) that represents ownership in a company. Having a company's stock
                                entitles the owner of the stock to voting rights within the company, and rights to the company's assets and profits,
                                proportional to the number of stocks owned. Some companies return a share of profits to stock owners (also called
                                shareholders) by a per-stock payout; this is called a "dividend". A company's stock changes in value over time; if a
                                stock is sold for a price exceeding the original purchase price, the seller is said to have made gains on his
                                original investment of capital, which is called "capital gains". Dividends and capital gains are two ways that
                                investors attempt to profit from stocks.
                            </p>

                                A "bond" can be thought of as a certificate of debt, or the record of a loan. Companies and governments issue bonds
                                to raise money. Investors give an amount of money (called the "bond principal"), and in exchange they are given a
                                bond which spells out what rate of interest (called the "coupon rate") the bond holder is entitled to, and when the
                                bond principal must be repaid. A bond can usually be traded like other securities, though the value of a bond
                                decreases over time as interest payments are made. Bonds are considered safer investments than stocks, for two
                                reasons: first, bonds tend to have a more stable value (so long as the issuer remains solvent); second, in the case
                                of bankrupcy, debts (including bonds) are paid before stockholders. Bonds investment gains usually lag
                                behind stocks over the long term. However, bonds are often used in low-risk investment portfolios; a retired investor
                                may be able to live off of the stable income of bond intrest without worrying as much about the state of the stock
                                exchange.

                                        A "mutual fund" is a managed bundle (or portfolio) of stocks, bonds, and other securities. In most cases, a mutual
                                        fund includes a large number of securities, with each individual security weighted proportionally according to the
                                        fund manager's decision. As an example, a fund might have allocations similar to the accompanying table.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A mutual fund's value is tied to securities within the fund, so if Company Alpha's stock value falls then the value of a
                                        mutual fund's share would fall proportionally. However, because a mutual fund's portfolio includes many different securities, the
                                        impact of one stock's negative or positive performance has a muted impact on the mutual fund as a whole. This is why
                                        mutual funds are often described as a "diversified investment". The method in which an investor profits from a mutual
                                        fund depends on the types of securities within the portfolio: some securities appreciate (increase) in value (capital
                                        gains), pay dividends, or pay interest.

                                Many people invest in mutual funds because they are diversified and managed according to an investment strategy.
                                However, there are a few drawbacks of which an investor should be aware.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    There are fees associated with investing in a mutual fund. Different funds have vastly different types of fees,
                                    so it is important to know what those fees are, and how it will affect your investment return.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Mutual fund shares do not entitle the owner to voting rights for any company within the fund. This fact may not
                                    be important for every investor, but some appreciate the "ownership" commanded by actual stocks.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Mutual fund shares are purchased or sold once per day. If you are a long-term investor, this should not be a
                                    problem. However, short-term investors (either intentionally or accidentally) should understand that mutual
                                    fund shares are not as "liquid" (easily converted to cash) as stocks; although, they are
                                    more liquid than some other securities.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                A "market index" is a theoretical portfolio which represents a segment of a market. For example, the Standard and Poor's
                                500 Index (also called the "S&P 500") is an index of 505 of the largest companies on the stock exchange; the "market"
                                is large capital companies. An "index fund" is a mutual fund which is managed according to the rules of an index; the
                                stocks, and proportions of stocks, identified by an index is followed by the corresponding index fund. Because the
                                makeup of indexes are known, and changes to indexes are widely available, the cost of managing an index fund is
                                generally lower than that of other types of mutual funds, which generally means that the fees associated with
                                investing in an index fund are very low compared to other managed accounts.
