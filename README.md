## Purpose
This is nothing more than a place to put some of the things I have learned over the years. Although my intent is to help, I admit that I am mostly "self-tought"; therefore, some the the information contained on this site may be out of date, or simply incorrect. If that is the case, you have my sincerest apologies.
